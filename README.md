## Try Before You Buy
To try out Managarr before linking it to your HTPC, you can use the purpose built [managarr-demo](https://github.com/Dark-Alex-17/managarr-demo) repository.
Simply run the following command to start a demo:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dark-Alex-17/managarr-demo/main/managarr-demo.sh > /tmp/managarr-demo.sh && bash /tmp/managarr-demo.sh
```

## Installation
### Cargo
If you have Cargo installed, then you can install Managarr from Crates.io:

```shell
cargo install managarr

# If you encounter issues installing, try installing with '--locked'
cargo install --locked managarr
```

### Docker
Run Managarr as a docker container by mounting your `config.yml` file to `/root/.config/managarr/config.yml`. For example:
```shell
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.config/managarr/config.yml:/root/.config/managarr/config.yml darkalex17/managarr
```

You can also clone this repo and run `make docker` to build a docker image locally and run it using the above command.

Please note that you will need to create and popular your configuration file first before starting the container. Otherwise, the container will fail to start.

### The Managarr CLI
Managarr can be used in one of two ways: As a TUI, or as a CLI for managing your Servarrs. 

All management features available in the TUI are also available in the CLI. However, the CLI is
equipped with additional features to allow for more advanced usage and automation.

The CLI can be helpful for automating tasks or for use in scripts. For example, you can use the CLI to trigger a search for a movie, or to add a movie to your Radarr library.

To see all available commands, simply run `managarr --help`:

```shell
$ managarr --help
managarr 0.4.0
Alex Clarke <alex.j.tusa@gmail.com>

A TUI and CLI to manage your Servarrs

Usage: managarr [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  radarr       Commands for manging your Radarr instance
  sonarr       Commands for manging your Sonarr instance
  completions  Generate shell completions for the Managarr CLI
  tail-logs    Tail Managarr logs
  help         Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --disable-spinner  Disable the spinner (can sometimes make parsing output challenging) [env: MANAGARR_DISABLE_SPINNER=]

```

All subcommands also have detailed help menus to show you how to use them. For example, to see all available commands for Sonarr, you would run:

```shell
$ managarr sonarr --help
Commands for manging your Sonarr instance

Usage: managarr sonarr [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  add                          Commands to add or create new resources within your Sonarr instance
  delete                       Commands to delete resources from your Sonarr instance

  toggle-episode-monitoring    Toggle monitoring for the specified episode
  toggle-season-monitoring     Toggle monitoring for the specified season that corresponds to the specified series ID
  help                         Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --disable-spinner  Disable the spinner (can sometimes make parsing output challenging) [env: MANAGARR_DISABLE_SPINNER=]
      --config <CONFIG>  The Managarr configuration file to use [env: MANAGARR_CONFIG_FILE=]
  -h, --help             Print help
```

**Pro Tip:** The CLI is even more powerful and useful when used in conjunction with the `jq` CLI tool. This allows you to parse the JSON response from the Managarr CLI and use it in your scripts; For example, to extract the `movieId` of the movie "Ad Astra", you would run:

```shell
$ managarr radarr list movies | jq '.[] | select(.title == "Ad Astra") | .id'
277
```

# Configuration
Managarr assumes reasonable defaults to connect to each service (i.e. Radarr is on localhost:7878),
but all servers will require you to input the API token.

The configuration file is located somewhere different for each OS.

### Linux
```
$HOME/.config/managarr/config.yml
```

### Mac
```
$HOME/Library/Application Support/managarr/config.yml
```

### Windows
```
%APPDATA%/Roaming/managarr/config.yml
```

## Specify Which Configuration File to Use
It can sometimes be useful to specify the configuration file you wish to use. This is useful in cases
where you may have more than one instance of a given Servarr running. Thus, you can specify the 
config file using the `--config` flag:

```shell
managarr --config /path/to/config.yml
```

### Example Configuration:
```yaml
radarr:
  host: 192.168.0.78
  port: 7878
  api_token: someApiToken1234567890
  ssl_cert_path: /path/to/radarr.crt # Required to enable SSL
sonarr:
  uri: http://htpc.local/sonarr # Example of using the 'uri' key instead of 'host' and 'port'
  api_token: someApiToken1234567890
readarr:
  host: 192.168.0.87
  port: 8787
  api_token: someApiToken1234567890
lidarr:
  host: 192.168.0.86
  port: 8686
  api_token: someApiToken1234567890
whisparr:
  host: 192.168.0.69
  port: 6969
  api_token: someApiToken1234567890
  ssl_cert_path: /path/to/whisparr.crt
bazarr:
  host: 192.168.0.67
  port: 6767
  api_token: someApiToken1234567890
prowlarr:
  host: 192.168.0.96
  port: 9696
  api_token: someApiToken1234567890
tautulli:
  host: 192.168.0.81
  port: 8181
  api_token: someApiToken1234567890
```

## Environment Variables
Managarr supports using environment variables on startup so you don't have to always specify certain flags:

| Variable                                | Description                                                                    | Equivalent Flag                  |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `MANAGARR_CONFIG_FILE`                  | Set the path to the config file                                                | `--config`                       |
| `MANAGARR_DISABLE_SPINNER`              | Disable the CLI spinner (this can be useful when scripting and parsing output) | `--disable-spinner`              |
