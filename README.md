# managarr - A TUI to manage your Servarrs
Managarr is a TUI to help you manage your HTPC (Home Theater PC). Built with ðŸ¤Ž in Rust!

![library](screenshots/library.png)

## NOTE: Managarr is not yet stable (Pre-Alpha)
I'm regularly making changes to get Managarr to an alpha release. As such, I'm regularly refactoring the code to be cleaner
and more easily extensible. Until I get Managarr across the alpha-release finish line, this regular refactoring will make
contributions difficult. Thus, stability is not guaranteed (yet!).

This means that while all tests will pass, there may be certain menus or keymappings that are no-ops, or produce empty 
screens, or things of this sort.

Part of the alpha release plan is to add contribution guidelines, CI/CD, release pipelines, etc. so that
all future maintenance and additions can be handled easily. So unfortunately, until that happens, Managarr may contain
breaking changes and be slow to react to any PR's.

Progress for the alpha release can be followed on my [Wekan Board](https://wekan.alexjclarke.com/b/dHoGjBb44MHM9HSv4/managarr)
with all items tagged `Alpha`.

Thanks for your patience as I work to get this into a place ready for contributions and to make developer experiences as
pleasant as possible!
